### Multiple Linear Regression Project

```markdown
# Project: Multiple Linear Regression

This project focuses on building a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict fuel efficiency (City mpg) based on vehicle characteristics like engine type, horsepower, and dimensions.

## Features

- **Regression Analysis:** Implements multiple linear regression to predict fuel efficiency.
- **Feature Analysis:** Analyzes vehicle characteristics that impact fuel efficiency.
- **Model Evaluation:** Provides metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aleenavarghese29/employee-data-processor.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd employee-data-processor/Project_1_Multiple_linear_regression
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to open `Project_1_Multiple_linear_regression (1).ipynb`.

4. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Ensure you have the dataset required in the working directory.
   - Run the cells in the notebook to execute the regression analysis.

## Assumptions & Design

- The dataset should contain features such as engine type, horsepower, and vehicle dimensions.
- The target variable for prediction is fuel efficiency (City mpg).
